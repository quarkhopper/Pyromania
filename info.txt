description = [h1]A mod for making the perfect blast or just frankly melting your face off[/h1]This mod is made for power users who want a lot of options to tweak to get that perfect looking explosion for your screenshots and videos. Use with the Cinematic Bomb and Bay Bomb to put together amazing scenes of destruction. If a little lag is a fair trade for action movie quality blasts then this is your mod![h1][/h1][h1]Three tools in one[/h1]Drop remotely detonated bombs (B) and blow them up (X). Fire a bunker busting rocket that buries itself in a target and rips it apart (LMB) or incinerate with the flamethrower (RMB). Not dangerous enough? press (M) for an explosion somewhere exexpected! Each weapon has several paramters to play with to customize the explosions (O), and because you asked for it, RAINBOW MODE. For descriptions of options, see: https://github.com/quarkhopper/Pyromania#readme [h1][/h1][h1]Want your own Smerp ragdolls?[/h1] If you want some fun little ragdolls to VAPORIZE, might I recommend my Smerp Spawner mod to you? They scream! You can automatically fill a map with them![h1][/h1][h1]Too much lag?[/h1] Head over to the in-game options (O) and over to the "General" options page. Turn those options down, and read my comments in the readme linked above for more you can do.[h1][/h1][h1]But... why?[/h1] Because I have issues.
