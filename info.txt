description = [b]A recent update changed how vector field data is culled a bit for performance reasons. If you are suddenly finding that your explosions last a really long time and look bubbly then turn your damping up one or two notches and you should be fine again. If you just installed the mod then the default values will already be set for this.[/b][h1][/h1][h1]A mod for making the perfect blast[/h1]This mod is made for power users who want a lot of options to tweak to get that perfect looking explosion for your screenshots and videos. Use with the Cinematic Bomb and Bay Bomb to put together amazing scenes of destruction. If a little lag is a fair trade for action movie quality blasts then this is your mod![h1][/h1][h1]Three tools in one[/h1]Drop remotely detonated bombs (B) and blow them up (X). Fire a bunker busting rocket (LMB) or incinerate with the flamethrower (RMB). Each weapon has several paramters to play with to customize the explosions (O), and because you asked for it, RAINBOW MODE. For descriptions of options, see: https://github.com/quarkhopper/Pyromania#readme [h1][/h1][h1]Need ragdolls?[/h1] If you want some fun little ragdolls to VAPORIZE, might I recommend my Smerp Spawner mod to you? They scream! [h1][/h1][h1]Too much lag?[/h1] Head over to the in-game options (O) and over to the "General" options page. Turn those options down, and read my comments in the readme linked above for more you can do.[h1][/h1][h1]But... why?[/h1] Because I have issues.
