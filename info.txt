description = [h1]Three tools in one[/h1]Drop remotely detonated bombs (B) and blow them up (X). Fire a bunker busting rocket (LMB) or incinerate with the flamethrower (RMB). Each weapon has several paramters to play with to customize the explosions (O), and because you asked for it, RAINBOW MODE. For descriptions of options, see: https://github.com/quarkhopper/Pyromania#readme [h1][/h1][h1]Need ragdolls?[/h1] If you want some fun little ragdolls to VAPORIZE, might I recommend my Smerp Spawner mod to you? They scream! [h1][/h1][h1]Too much lag?[/h1] Head over to the in-game options (O) and over to the "General" options page. Turn those options down, and read my comments in the readme linked above for more you can do.[h1][/h1][h1]But... why?[/h1] Because I have issues.
