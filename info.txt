description = [h1]A mod for making the perfect blast or just frankly melting your face off[/h1]This mod is made for fans of the big cinema explosion, with tools that have the firepower to melt a city. A page of options for every tool lets you truly design your own blast.[h1][/h1][h1]Three tools in one[/h1]Drop remotely detonated bombs (B) and blow them up (X). Fire a bunker busting rocket that buries itself in a target and rips it apart (LMB) or incinerate with the flamethrower (RMB). Not dangerous enough? press (M) for an explosion somewhere exexpected! Each weapon has several paramters to play with to customize the explosions (O), and because you asked for it, RAINBOW MODE. For descriptions of options, see: https://github.com/quarkhopper/Pyromania#readme [h1][/h1][h1]DANGER ! ACTION MOVIE MODE ! DANGER[/h1] Why does this exist?? This isn't safe at all! F5 to toggle on/off. Creates an explosion near you every three seconds! RUN! Distance is set in the bomb tool options under minimum random explosion distance (why does this setting exist??).[h1][/h1][h1]Want your own Smerp ragdolls?[/h1] If you want some fun little ragdolls to VAPORIZE, might I recommend my Smerp Spawner mod to you? They scream! You can automatically fill a map with them![h1][/h1][h1]Too much lag?[/h1] Head over to the in-game options (O) and over to the "General" options page. Turn those options down, and read my comments in the readme linked above for more you can do.[h1][/h1][h1]But... why?[/h1] Because I have issues.
