description = [h1]Just fireballs and doom, [i]now with less lag™️[/i], kind of![/h1] Shockwaves, huge cinematic fireballs, flamethrowing, bunker busting, safe and legal action! Drop remotely detonated bombs (B) and blow them up (X). Fire a bunker busting rocket that breaks into a target and rips it inside out (LMB), or incinerate with the flamethrower (RMB). Not dangerous enough? press (M) for an explosion somewhere exexpected! Each weapon has several paramters to play with to customize the explosions (O), and because you asked for it, RAINBOW MODE. For descriptions of options, see: https://github.com/quarkhopper/Pyromania#readme [h1][/h1][h1]But there's still lag, I hear you say.[/h1] Head over to the in-game options (O) and over to the "General" options page. Turn those options down, and read my comments in the readme linked above for more you can do. But honestly, this mod wasn't made it real time performance in mind, it was made with video recording and screenshots in mind. If decent looking blasts without little lag are your thing maybe try out Cinematic Bomb. For this mod, I tried to get fire to flow through structures and rip things apart in a more volumetric fashion rather than just pummeling the crap out of things (which is, surprisingly, easier on the CPU). [h1][/h1][h1]Want your own Smerp ragdolls?[/h1] If you want some fun little ragdolls to VAPORIZE, might I recommend my Smerp Spawner mod to you? They scream! You can automatically fill a map with them![h1][/h1][h1]But... why?[/h1] There are some who call me...  Tim
